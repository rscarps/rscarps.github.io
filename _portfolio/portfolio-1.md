**DevOps Deployment API Documentation** is a technical writing portfolio project that showcases developer-focused API documentation skills using real-world DevOps concepts.

This project simulates a RESTful API for deploying applications to Kubernetes clusters via CI/CD pipelines. The documentation includes:

- A fully structured [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification (`openapi.yaml`)
- An interactive **Swagger UI** experience for exploring endpoints
- Clear and concise Markdown-based content written with [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and published via **GitHub Pages**
- Real-world usage examples with `curl`, GitHub Actions, and CLI integration
- Detailed sections covering authentication, endpoints, error handling, and changelog

By combining modern documentation tools with DevOps deployment workflows, this project demonstrates the ability to create clear, maintainable, and developer-friendly API docs that can be embedded in a product or developer portal.
